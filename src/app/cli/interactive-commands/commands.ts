/**
 * CLI Commands Module (Modular Version)
 *
 * This module aggregates all CLI commands from extracted modular components.
 * It maintains the same external interface as the original monolithic commands.ts
 * while using the new modular structure internally.
 *
 * The commands are organized into logical modules:
 * - General Commands: Basic CLI functionality (help, exit, clear)
 * - Conversation Commands: Session management, history, and search
 * - Model Commands: Model switching and configuration
 * - MCP Commands: MCP server management
 * - System Commands: Configuration, logging, and statistics
 * - Tool Commands: Tool listing and management
 * - Prompt Commands: System prompt management
 * - Documentation Commands: Help and documentation access
 *
 * This file serves as the integration layer that combines all modular commands
 * into a single CLI_COMMANDS array for the command execution system.
