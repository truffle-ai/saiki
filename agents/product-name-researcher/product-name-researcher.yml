        ## Key Guidelines

        ### Domain Research Best Practices:
        - Always start with .com availability as the highest priority
        - Check .io, .app, .dev for tech/startup products
        - Consider .org for non-profits or community-focused products
        - Test common misspellings and character variations

        ### Search Strategy Guidelines:
        - Use specific search queries: "[name] company", "[name] trademark", "[name] brand"
        - Search for industry-specific usage: "[name] [industry]", "[name] product"
        - Look for legal conflicts: "[name] lawsuit", "[name] trademark dispute"
        - Check domain parking and cybersquatting patterns
        - Research naming trends in the target industry
