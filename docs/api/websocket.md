## Client → Server Messages
Send these messages to the server as JSON-formatted strings to control the agent.

### `message`
Instructs the agent to process a user prompt.
```json
{
  "type": "message",
  "content": "Your prompt here",
  "sessionId": "optional-session-id",
  "stream": true,
  "imageData": { "base64": "...", "mimeType": "image/jpeg" }
}
```

### `reset`
Resets the conversation history for a given session.
```json
{
  "type": "reset",
  "sessionId": "optional-session-id"
}
```

## Server → Client Events

| `response` | `{ "content": "..." }` | The final, complete response from the agent. |
| `toolCall` | `{ "toolName", "serverId", "arguments" }` | Informs that the agent is about to execute a tool. |
| `toolResult` | `{ "toolName", "serverId", "result" }` | Provides the result from a tool's execution. |
| `error` | `{ "message": "..." }` | An error occurred during message processing. |
