## What You'll Build

An image editor agent that can:
- Analyze image metadata and properties
- Resize and crop images with intelligent aspect ratio handling
- Convert between image formats with quality control
- Apply filters and effects (blur, sharpen, grayscale, sepia, etc.)
- Adjust brightness, contrast, and color properties
- Add text overlays and annotations
- Detect objects, faces, and visual features
- Create image collages and compositions

## Understanding the Architecture

The image editor agent follows Saiki's framework design with clear separation of responsibilities:

1. **MCP Server**: Sets up the server and exposes image processing tools to the agent
2. **Agent**: Orchestrates workflows and handles user interaction
3. **Tools**: Contain the actual image processing logic

This architecture allows the agent to focus on understanding user intent while the tools handle the technical image processing.

## Step 1: Setting Up the Project

First, let's understand the project structure:

```
agents/image-editor-agent/
├── python-server/           # Python MCP server implementation
│   ├── main.py             # Main server with all tools
│   ├── pyproject.toml      # Python dependencies
│   └── temp_images/        # Temporary image storage
├── image-editor-agent.yml  # Agent configuration
├── setup-python-server.sh  # Automated setup script
└── README.md               # Documentation
```

## Step 2: Installing Dependencies

The image editor agent uses Python with OpenCV and Pillow for image processing. Let's set it up:

```bash
# Navigate to the image editor agent directory
cd agents/image-editor-agent

# Run the automated setup script
./setup-python-server.sh
```

This script will:
- Install the `uv` package manager if needed
- Install Python dependencies (OpenCV, Pillow, FastMCP)
- Test the installation
- Verify the agent configuration

### What's Happening Behind the Scenes

The setup script installs these key dependencies:
- **OpenCV**: Computer vision and image processing
- **Pillow**: Python Imaging Library for image manipulation
- **FastMCP**: Model Context Protocol server framework
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing for image data

## Step 3: Understanding the Agent Configuration

The agent is configured in `image-editor-agent.yml`:

```yaml
systemPrompt: |
  You are an AI assistant specialized in image editing and processing. You have access to a comprehensive set of tools for manipulating images including:
  
  - **Basic Operations**: Resize, crop, convert formats
  - **Filters & Effects**: Blur, sharpen, grayscale, sepia, invert, edge detection, emboss, vintage
  - **Adjustments**: Brightness, contrast, color adjustments
  - **Text & Overlays**: Add text to images with customizable fonts and colors
  - **Computer Vision**: Face detection, edge detection, contour analysis, circle detection, line detection
  - **Analysis**: Detailed image statistics, color analysis, histogram data

mcpServers:
  image_editor:
    type: stdio
    command: uv
    args:
      - run
      - --project
      - agents/image-editor-agent/python-server
      - python
      - agents/image-editor-agent/python-server/main.py
    connectionMode: strict

llm:
  provider: openai
  model: gpt-4o-mini
  apiKey: $OPENAI_API_KEY
```

### Key Components Explained

1. **systemPrompt**: Defines the agent's capabilities and behavior
2. **mcpServers**: Connects to the Python MCP server
3. **llm**: Configures the language model for intelligent interaction

## Step 4: Available Tools

The image editor agent provides 20+ powerful tools organized into categories:

### Image Analysis
- `get_image_info` - Get detailed image metadata (dimensions, format, file size)
- `preview_image` - Get a base64 preview for UI display
- `analyze_image` - Comprehensive image analysis with statistics
- `show_image_details` - Display detailed image information

### Basic Operations
- `resize_image` - Resize images with aspect ratio preservation
- `crop_image` - Crop images to specific dimensions
- `convert_format` - Convert between image formats
- `create_thumbnail` - Create small preview images

### Filters & Effects
- `apply_filter` - Apply various filters (blur, sharpen, grayscale, sepia, etc.)
- `adjust_brightness_contrast` - Adjust brightness and contrast levels

### Drawing & Annotations
- `add_text_to_image` - Add text overlays with custom fonts and colors
- `draw_rectangle` - Draw rectangles on images
- `draw_circle` - Draw circles on images
- `draw_line` - Draw lines on images
- `draw_arrow` - Draw arrows on images
- `add_annotation` - Add text annotations with backgrounds

### Computer Vision
- `detect_objects` - Detect faces, edges, contours, circles, lines

### Advanced Features
- `create_collage` - Create image collages with various layouts
- `create_collage_template` - Use predefined collage templates
- `batch_process` - Process multiple images with the same operation
- `compare_images` - Compare two images side by side

### Utility
- `list_available_filters` - List all available filter options
- `list_collage_templates` - List available collage templates

## Step 5: Running the Agent

Start the image editor agent:

```bash
# From the project root
saiki --agent agents/image-editor-agent/image-editor-agent.yml
```

## Step 6: Testing with Example Prompts

Let's test the agent with some example prompts to understand how it works:

### Basic Image Analysis
```
"Get information about the image at /path/to/image.jpg"
```
**What happens**: The agent calls `get_image_info` to retrieve dimensions, format, and file size.

### Image Transformation
```
"Resize the image to 800x600 pixels while maintaining aspect ratio"
```
**What happens**: The agent calls `resize_image` with `maintainAspectRatio: true` to preserve proportions.

### Applying Filters
```
"Apply a sepia filter to make the image look vintage"
```
**What happens**: The agent calls `apply_filter` with `filter: "sepia"` to create a vintage effect.

### Adding Text
```
"Add the text 'Hello World' at coordinates (50, 50) with white color"
```
**What happens**: The agent calls `add_text_to_image` with the specified text, position, and color.

### Computer Vision
```
"Detect faces in the image"
```
**What happens**: The agent calls `detect_objects` with `detectionType: "faces"` to find faces.

### Creating Collages
```
"Create a collage of these three images in a grid layout"
```
**What happens**: The agent calls `create_collage` with the image paths and grid layout.

## Step 7: Understanding the Workflow

Here's how the three components work together in a typical interaction:

1. **User Request**: "Make this image brighter and add a watermark"
2. **Agent**: Interprets the request and orchestrates the workflow
3. **Tools**: Agent calls the processing functions:
   - `adjust_brightness_contrast()` - increases image brightness
   - `add_text_to_image()` - adds watermark text
4. **Response**: Agent provides the result with image context

### Example Workflow
```
User: "Take this image, resize it to 500x500, apply a blur filter, and add the text 'SAMPLE' at the bottom"

Agent Response:
"I'll help you process that image. Let me break this down into steps:
1. First, I'll resize the image to 500x500 pixels
2. Then I'll apply a blur filter
3. Finally, I'll add the text 'SAMPLE' at the bottom

[Executes tools and provides results]"
```

## Supported Formats

### Input Formats
- **JPG/JPEG**: Most common compressed format
