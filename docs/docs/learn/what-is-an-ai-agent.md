# What is an AI Agent?

An **AI agent** is an autonomous software entity that can perceive its environment, reason about what it observes, and take actions to achieve specific goals.

AI Agents use LLMs as the backbone to reason about what it observes, and take actions to achieve specific goals.

They use tools to interact with the world, and can use memories to remember what they have done in the past.

## Key Characteristics

- **Autonomy:** Operates independently, making decisions without constant human intervention.
- **Perception:** Gathers information from its environment (e.g., via tools, user input, or custom prompts).
- **Reasoning:** Processes information, plans, and makes decisions based on goals and context.
- **Action:** Executes tasks, commands, or workflows to achieve its objectives.
- **Learning (optional):** Some agents can adapt and improve over time

## What is Saiki?

Saiki is a framework to help you build customizable, flexible AI Agents.

Saiki AI agents can:
- Understand natural language instructions from users
- Select and orchestrate the right tools, apps, or services to fulfill those instructions
- Automate complex workflows by chaining together multiple actions

**Example:**
> "Summarize my latest emails and send the highlights to Slack."

A Saiki AI agent hooked up to your email and Slack will:
1. Parse your request
2. Summarize the emails
3. Send the summary to Slack — all automatically

## Why AI Agents Matter

Think Jarvis from Iron Man, or TARS from Interstellar.

These AI agents are powerful entities that are extremely helpful in getting things done.

AI agents make it possible to automate tasks that would otherwise require manual effort or custom scripting. They are the foundation for building intelligent, user-friendly experiences. 

We think that we are going to be seeing a lot more AI Agents in the coming years!
