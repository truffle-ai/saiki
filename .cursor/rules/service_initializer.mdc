- **Configuration Source of Truth**
  - The config file (e.g., `agent.yml`) is the primary source for both high-level and low-level service options (e.g., LLM provider, compression strategies for MessageManager).
  - All user-facing and environment-specific configuration should be handled via the config file for clarity, auditability, and ease of use.

- **Override Pattern for Advanced/Test Use**
  - Use the `InitializeServicesOptions` type to override only top-level services (e.g., `MessageManager`, `LLMService`, `ClientManager`) for advanced, programmatic, or test scenarios.
  - Do **not** expose every internal dependency as a code-level override. If you need to customize internals (e.g., a custom compression strategy), construct the service yourself and inject it as a top-level override.

- **Best Practices**
  - ✅ DO: Use the config file for normal operation and low-level tuning.
  - ✅ DO: Use top-level service overrides for code/test/advanced scenarios.
  - ❌ DON'T: Add every internal dependency to `InitializeServicesOptions` unless there is a strong, recurring need.
  - ✅ DO: Document this pattern in code comments and keep the override API surface small and maintainable.

- **Examples**
```typescript
// ✅ DO: Use config for compression strategies
// In agent.yml:
messages:
  compression:
    - type: middle
      preserveStart: 4
      preserveEnd: 5
    - type: oldest
      minMessagesToKeep: 4

// ✅ DO: Use code override for top-level service in tests
const testMessageManager = new MessageManager(...);
initializeServices(config, { messageManager: testMessageManager });

// ❌ DON'T: Add every internal (e.g., compressionStrategy) to InitializeServicesOptions
```
